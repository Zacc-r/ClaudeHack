# Key Decisions Log

---

### [10:45 AM] Project Structure
- **Decision**: Separate `ceo-files/` (strategy docs) from `ai-agents/` (runtime/memory)
- **Reason**: Clean separation of planning vs execution context
- **Impact**: All agents know where to find strategy vs runtime state

### [10:45 AM] Fresh GitHub Repo
- **Decision**: Brand new repo "ClaudeHack" — zero prior code
- **Reason**: Transparency for hackathon judges, clean start
- **Impact**: Everything built from scratch today, fully auditable
